# lego
That is an interesting project created using Node.js, Socket.io and THREE.js. 

In that project you can build different lego buildings with your friends at the same field. Just enter localhost:3000 and start playing.


How to navigate:

click - create a new block

ctr- change block size

space- change block position

esc- change block color

NOTE: you can't build on others buildings, so some maligant friends can't ruin your building
